## 🛢️ Project_SQL_101  
### 📚 Tamayoz School Database  

This project was completed as part of the **SQL 101** course on [Satr.codes](https://satr.codes), where I built a structured database for a school named **Tamayoz School**.

### 🔍 Key Highlights:
- Created 3 main tables: `students`, `teachers`, and `subjects`
- Inserted realistic mock data:
  - 30 student records
  - 10 teacher records
  - 6 subject entries
- Demonstrated SQL queries such as `SELECT`, `ORDER BY`, `UPDATE`, and `RENAME TABLE`
- Covered important SQL concepts:
  - ✅ Data types & constraints
  - ✅ Aliasing
  - ✅ Table relationships
  - ✅ Basic data manipulation

### 💻 Example Queries:

```sql
-- Display all students ordered by name
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY Student_name ASC;

-- Update student email
UPDATE students SET Student_email = 'updated_email@tamayoz.edu' WHERE id = 1;

-- Rename teachers table to instructors
RENAME TABLE teachers TO instructors
```

- This is the is the certificate you will get after you finish the course.
